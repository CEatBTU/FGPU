# FGPU
FGPU is a soft GPU-like architecture for FPGAs. It can be programmed using OpenCL and customized according to application needs.

This repository contains some benchmarks that run on this architecture.

It is planned that FGPU will be open-source soon.

##Supported Boards
Currently, only the ZC706 development board is supported.
