# FGPU
FGPU is a soft GPU-like architecture for FPGAs. It can be programmed using OpenCL and can be customized according to application needs.

The PYNQ interface of FGPU can be accessed on this [link](https://github.com/malkadi/FGPU_IPython).


##Repository Structure
+ Setup information is available in the `scripts` folder
+ Benchmarks are available in the `benchmark` folder
+ Source VHDL files for FGPU and simulation files are located in the `RTL` folder
+ The LLVM backend files are stored in the `llvm-3.7.1.src.fgpu` folder
+ All synthesis and implementation files and reports with the generated bitsream can be found in `HW`
+ `bitstreams` contains pre-generated bitstreams
+ OpenCL kernels and their compilation scripts are located in the `kernels` folder
