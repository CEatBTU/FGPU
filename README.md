# FGPU
FGPU is a soft GPU-like architecture for FPGAs. It can be programmed using OpenCL and can be customized according to application needs.

The repository contains now only some benchmarks.

The PYNQ interface of FGPU can be accessed on this [link](https://github.com/malkadi/FGPU_IPython).

FGPU will be open-source soon!

+ Setup information is available in the `scripts` folder
