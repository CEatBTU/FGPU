FGPU requires a library for floating-point logic if hardware-support is needed.
This library is generated using the Xilinx floating-point IP-core with different settings.
If this is done with some Vivado version, it may not be usable in a future one!!!
Therefore, we have to provide a library for each Vivado version!
